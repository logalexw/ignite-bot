•ignitebot• is a Discord bot created as an extension of the •ignite• web app created for Stanford's TreeHacks 2022! This bot is a mindfulness buddy to battle burnout and keep you cool, and mimics the style of pomodoro timers.

This bot was built using the discord.py module, and is hosted on Replit. This code represents the locally hosted iteration that our team used for development and testing.

Gareth Dwyer's article was particluarly helpful in the development of this bot, and can be found here: https://www.codementor.io/@garethdwyer/building-a-discord-bot-with-python-and-repl-it-miblcwejzs
